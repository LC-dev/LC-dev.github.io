I am a first year Master's thesis student in Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) and [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), co-advised by Prof. [Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/) and Dr. [Khimya Khetarpal](https://kkhetarpal.github.io/#research). I previously earned a Bachelor's degree in Honours Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, where I was advised by Prof. [Yaoyao Fiona Zhao](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/yaoyao-zhao). 

My current research interests revolve around combining _reinforcement learning_ (RL), _deep learning_, and _ideas from psychology_ (see [affordances, Gibson 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance)) _to develop broadly intelligent agents that can efficiently, continually, and robustly adapt in real-world environments with large action spaces_. I am also interested in how we might be able to _leverage large powerful generative models to benefit RL_ agents' learning and performance. 

During my undergraduate, I developed AI solutions for cybersecurity at Dell Technologies/Secureworks, built robots that paint beautiful artwork at Acrylic Robotics, and worked on computer-vision-based anomaly selection for metal 3D printing processes, amongst others. I also co-produced the [McGill AI Podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1832809) where we discussed AI research, ethics, and applications with distinguished contributors in the field.
