I am a second-year M.S. research student in Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), co-advised by Prof. [Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/) and Dr. [Khimya Khetarpal](https://kkhetarpal.github.io). My research is generously supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec (FRQNT) and Mila. I previously earned a B.Eng. in Honours Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, also at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca).

My current research focuses on building:
1. **Efficient** agents by leveraging foundation models (e.g., LLMs/VLMs) as priors
2. **Continual** learning agents
3. AI **safety** and **alignment**

During my undergraduate, I developed AI solutions for cybersecurity at [Dell Technologies](https://www.dell.com/en-ca)/[Secureworks](https://www.secureworks.com), built robots that paint beautiful artwork at [Acrylic Robotics](https://www.acrylicrobotics.ca), and worked on computer-vision-based anomaly selection for metal 3D printing processes, amongst others. I also co-produced the [McGill AI Podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1832809) where we discussed AI research, ethics, and applications with distinguished contributors in the field. 

Outside of research, I run, weight lift, cycle, read, and play the piano.

Feel free to reach out for anything research related, always happy to chat!
