What does it mean for an artificial intelligence model to do the right thing? What are researchers and governments doing to ensure that the use of AI technologies does not infringe on human rights? These are two of the questions that we touch on in this conversation with Dr. Su Lin Blodgett and Prof. Fenwick McKelvey. The world of AI has seen an explosion of progress in recent years and this has opened up exciting new applications for these models. However, the issue of reflecting human biases, which has long been plaguing these models, is far from solved. On top of this, the applications in which such models can be used remain poorly regulated, at least within Canada. In this episode, spanning across fields like computer science, media, and technology policy, we try to understand why these questions are essential to address, and how we can start thinking about solutions that take into account a plurality of perspectives.
