The advent of powerful generative AI models - particularly in the art space - has enabled limitless creative opportunities. In this episode, we discuss both the usage benefits and the importance of regulating generative AI in this space from a diverse stakeholder perspective. Chloë Ryan, CEO and founder of Acrylic Robotics - a fast-growing pre-seed art-tech startup, Katherine Beaulieu, a BCL/JD Candidate at the McGill Faculty of Law & member of Tech Law, and Dr. Kussil Oumedjbeur, a current MSc candidate in experimental surgery at McGill and popular digital artist, join us in a panel to discuss the ethical and regulatory challenges involved in the usage of generative AI in the art space.
